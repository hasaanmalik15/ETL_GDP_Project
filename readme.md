<h2>Extract Transform Load (ETL) Project</h2>

The project is to develop a project that extracts the list of countries ranked by their GDP, using Web Scrapping, then Transform the extracted data and Load the transformed data into a CSV and Databse.

Key objectives for this project include:

Extract: Develop a data extraction function that collects the required GDP information from the designated URL, using Web Scrapping 

Transform: Converts the GDP information from 'Million USD' to 'Billion USD' to tranform the GDP into Billions

Load: Store the transformed data in two formats, as a CSV file and in a database file.

Query the Database: Execute query on the database to retrieve entries with a GDP exceeding 100 billion USD.

Logs: Create a detailed log of the script's execution on each step, documenting important steps with appropriate timestamps.

As a whole, this project is about Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipline and Web Scrapping using Python and its libraries like "pandas", "numpy", "beautifulsoup", "requests", "sqlite3".
